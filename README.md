# cms-dl [NOW DEPRECATED.SEE NOTE FOR DETAILS]
A Python script for downloading course material and updates for students of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.

Note :
This project has now been deprecated, after the changes to the CMS website. The purpose of this project was just to learn Python, and having fulfilled that, I don't see any point in continuing it. 

However, please feel free to fork/pull request in case you wish to continue from where I left.

P.S. This was my first ever project in Python, and coding in general. So please go easy on me regarding unPythonic/unoptimised/noob code. I know there are a lot of improvements which could be done, and I hope to do those in my future projects :) .
